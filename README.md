# RRT_Planners
Implementation of RRT and Greedy RRT in Python


In this project we have implemented RRT which is a motion planning algorithm used widely in robotics. It stands for Rapidly Exploring Random Tree. There are many types of motion planners but RRTs are used often because:
1) RRTs can find paths in an **n-dimensional scenario**, 
2) They have **probabilistic completeness**
3) They do not require a predetermined map and can **expand into unexplored regions of the C-space**.
4) Paths can be found even if start and goal configurations are varied (**multiple queries**)
